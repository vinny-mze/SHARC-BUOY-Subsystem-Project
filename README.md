# SHARC BUOY Subsystem Project
The ARM based digital IP is a subsystem of the SHARC Buoy System. The SHARC BUOY System is in Antartica where is collects data from multiple sensors such as the gyroscope, magnetometer, tempreture sensor, humidity sensor. This subsystem will be responsible for
compressing the data collection from the IMU sensor and encrypt the data so that it can be
transmitted for processing. Upon receival, the data is decrypted and decompression so that the data can be used for further analysis.
